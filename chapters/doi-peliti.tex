The response and Onsager-Machlup formalism is useful for perturbative calculations, however, it relies on some assumption which do not always hold.
Most importantly, if we cannot describe the small time-step as a Gaussian process, or/and the random variable in question cannot be modeled as continuous, then it fails.
Examples of discrete processes are birth and death processes with low population number, or discrete jump processes, automata or reaction-diffusion processes.
In this case, we can instead use the Doi-Peliti formalism.
To derive this, we start with the master equation, as we derived in (REF).

\section{Discrete master equation}

We will consider one or more random variables $N(t) \in \NN$.
The corresponding master equation is
%
\begin{align}
    \partial_t P(N, t)
    = 
    \sum_{N'}
    \left\{
        W_t(N | N') P(N, t)
        - W_t(N'|N)P(N, t)
    \right\}.
\end{align}
%
To recap, the first term is the gain term, while the second is the loss-term.
The $W$'s are transition rates, infinite dimensional matrices that contain the rates at which one state transition into another.
The result is an infinite set of ODE's for the probabilities $P(N, t)$.
Some examples of these processes are
\note{Maybe should write $P_N(t)$, then ordianry derivative instead, since its ODEs?}

This process represents one set of particles, labeled $A$, which decays at a constant rate, $\epsilon$, to nothing $(\emptyset)$, as illustrated by the arrow above.
$N(t)$ then represent the total numbers of particles of type $A$,
and the transition rates are the decay rate, $\epsilon$, times the number of particles.
The corresponding master equation is represented the rate at which the system transitions into, minus the rat out of, state $N$,
%
\begin{align}
    \partial_t P(N, t) = 
    \epsilon
    \left[
        (N + 1) P(N+1, t)
        - 
        N P(N, t)
    \right].
\end{align}
%
The steady-state is a probability distribution $P(N, t) = P_S(N, t$ ) so that $\partial_t P(N) = 0$, and the only such state is
%
\begin{align}
    P_S(N) = \delta_{N,0},
\end{align}
%
the ``emtpy state''.

We may derive a differential equation for the expected number of particles, $\E{N(t)}$, by ``applying'' $\sum_N N \cdot$ to  the master equation, which yields
%
\begin{align}
    \partial_t
    \underbrace{\sum_N N P(N, t)}_{\E{N(t)}}
    &= 
    \epsilon
    \sum_{N}
    \bigg\{
        \underbrace{N(N + 1)}_{(N_1)^2-(N+1)}P(N+1,t)
        - NP(N,t) k
    \bigg\}\\
    & = 
    \epsilon
    \left\{
        \E{N(t)^2} - \E{N(t)} - \E{N(t)^2}
    \right\}
    =     \epsilon \E{N(t)},
\end{align}
%
This is solved by $\E{N(t)} = N(0) e^{-\epsilon t}$.

This is the converse process, with the master equation
%
\begin{align}
    \partial_t P(N, t)
    = 
    \gamma 
    \left\{
        P(N - 1, t) - P(N, t)
    \right\}.
\end{align}
%
One may notice this has no steady state, as this would require $P_S(N) = P_S(N+1)$, a uniform distribution on the natural numbers, which is unnormalizable.


\subsection*{Dynamic steady state

\right)

}

A generic property of the processes considered here is that we may always consider the combination of two processes by adding together the right-hand sides of the corresponding master equations.
The master equation for the spontaneous creation and annihilation process is therefore
%
\begin{align}
    \partial_t P(N, t) = 
    \epsilon
    \left[
        (N + 1) P(N+1, t)
        - 
        N P(N, t)
    \right]
    +
    \gamma 
    \left\{
        P(N - 1, t) - P(N, t)
    \right\}.
\end{align}
%
Assuming $P(N<0) = 0$ gives the steady state,
%
\begin{align}
    P_S(N) = \frac{ P_S(0) }{ N! } \left(\frac{ \gamma }{ \epsilon }\right)^N
    =
    \frac{ 1 }{ N! } \left(\frac{ \gamma }{ \epsilon }\right)^N e^{-\gamma/\epsilon},
\end{align}
%
which is the Poission distribution.

A general process has $k$ species, labeled $A_i$, with $i\in\{1, \dots k\}$, $j_i$ label the number of species $i$ is needed for the process, while $\ell_i$ are the number of $i$ that are left after the reaction (reactants and products), which has rate $r$.

    = r \binom{N_1}{\ell_1} \cdots \binom{N_k}{\ell_k}
\end{align}
%


\subsection*{Processes in space}

We can imendiatly generate to processes in space, by considering $A_i$ to be a particle on lattice site $i$.
If we consider an equal probability of jumping left or right, hopping rate $D / h^2$, where $h$ is the lattice spacing, then the master equation is
%
\begin{align}
    \partial_t P(\bm N, t) 
    = 
    \frac{ D }{ h^2 } \sum_{j\in \Z}\sum_{\E{x,j}}
    \left[ (N_x + 1) P(\bm N + 1_x - 1_j,t) - N_x P(\bm N, t) \right].
\end{align}
%
Here, $\bm N$ is the vector of occupation number at the different sites, and $1_x$ is the vector with only $1$ at site $x$, $0$ elsewhere, and the bracket means sum over nearest neighbourrs.
Applying $\sum_{\bm N} N_x \cdot$, we get
%
\begin{align}
    \E{N_x(t)} = D \nabla^2_x \E{N_x(t)},
\end{align}
%
the (discrete) diffusion equation.


\section{Probability generating function}

We define the function
%
\begin{align}
    \Em(z, t) = \sum_N z^N P(N, t)
\end{align}
%
for a single proces, or for many procesess,
%
\begin{align}
    \Em(z_1, ... z_K, t) 
    =
    \Em(\bm z, t) 
    = \sum_{\bm N} z^{N_1}\cdots z^{N_k} P(\bm N, t).
\end{align}
%
This is called the probability generating function because we can obtain the probability of having the state $N = \ell$ by taking derivatives of it,
%
\begin{align}
    P(\ell, t) = \frac{ 1 }{ \ell! } \partial_z^\ell \Em(z, t)\big|_{z = 0}.
\end{align}
%
Notice that, for all $t$, $M(z = 1, t) = 1$.

If we again consider the master equation for the birth and death process,
%
\begin{align}
    \partial_t P(N, t) = 
    \epsilon
    \left[
        (N + 1) P(N+1, t)
        - 
        N P(N, t)
    \right]
    +
    \gamma 
    \left\{
        P(N - 1, t) - P(N, t)
    \right\},
\end{align}
%
and apply $\sum_N z^N \cdot$, we get an equation for $\Em$,
%
\begin{align}
    \partial_t \Em(z, t) 
    &= 
    \epsilon 
    \sum_N 
    \left\{
        \underbrace{z^N (N + 1)}_{\partial_z z^{N + 1}} P(N + 1, t)
        - 
        \underbrace{z^N N}_{z \partial_z z^N} P(N, t )
    \right\}
    +
    \gamma \sum_N
    z^N
    \left\{
         P(N-1, t) - P(N, t)
    \right\}\\
    & = \epsilon (1 - z) \partial_z \Em(z, t)
    + \gamma (z - 1) \Em(z, t).
\end{align}
%
If we consider steady state $\partial_t \Em = 0$, we get 
%
\begin{align}
    \Em_S(z) = \Em_0 e^{\gamma /\epsilon z}
    \implies
    P_S(N) = 
    \frac{ 1 }{ N! }
    \left(\frac{ \gamma }{ \epsilon }\right)^N 
    e^{-\gamma/\epsilon},
\end{align}
%
as before.

\begin{framed}
    \textit{Exercise:}
    Show that, for the generic process described above, the equation of the generating function is
    %
    \begin{align}
        \partial_t \Em(\bm z, t)
        = \frac{ r }{ \prod_k \ell_k ! }
        \left[
            \left(
                \prod_k z^{j_k}_k \partial_{z_k}^{\ell_k}
            \right)
            -
            \left(
                \prod_k z^{\ell_k}_k \partial_{z_k}^{\ell_k}
            \right)
        \right]
        \Em(\bm z, t).
    \end{align}
    %
\end{framed}

We end this section with a note: although the definition of the generating function is analytic, as it is a power series, the result differential equations may have non-analytic solutions, which must be discarded.
We may also obtain moments from the generating functions by exploiting its analytical properties to write
%
\begin{align}
    \E{N^k(t)}
    = 
    \sum_N \left(z \odv{  }{ z }\right)^k z^N P(N) \big|_{z=1}
    = 
    \left(z \odv{  }{ z }\right)^k \Em(z, t).
\end{align}
%



\section{Second quantization}

With the definition and properties of the probability generating function clear, we now introduce a new formalism called \emph{second quantization}, due to its close relation to the similarly named formalism of quantum field theory.
This formalism is a mapping of the objects from the previous chapter to a new notation.
This mapping has the following dicitionary,

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|c}
        Usual & 2nd quant. \\[.1cm]
        \hline\\[-.2cm]
        Factors of $z^N$ & particle state $\ket{N}$ \\[.1cm]
        Multiplication with $z$ & Creation operator $a^\dagger$\\[.1cm]
        Derivative $\odv{  }{ z }$ & Annihilation operator $a$ \\[.1cm]
        PGF $\Em(z, t)$ & System state $\ket{\Em(t)}$
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

If the PGF is $\Em(z, t) = Z^M$, then $P(N, t) = \delta_{N,M}$, so we may write
%
\begin{align}
    \ket{\Em(t)} = \sum_N P(N, t) \ket{N}.
\end{align}
%
This is familiar to anyone who has done some many-particle quantum mechanics---a state is the linear combination of states with different numbers of particles.
Likewise, we have
%
\begin{align}
    a\ket{N} &= N \ket{N},&
    a^\dagger\ket{N} &= \ket{N+1},&
    [a^\dagger, a] \equiv a^\dagger a - a a^\dagger = 1.
\end{align}
%
The last term is the familiar canonical commutation relation for bosons.
One may consider fermionic systems, representing exclusion processes where only a finite number of particles can occupy a state, but we will keep to bosons here.

If we have multi species systems, the generalization is straight forward.
The states, operators and their commutations are denote
%
\begin{align}
    \ket{N_1, \dots N_k}
    = \ket{\bm N}
    , &&
    a_i,\, a_j^\dagger, &&
    [a_i^\dagger, a_j] & = \delta_{ij}.
\end{align}
%
The equation for the state vector can now be written on a form similar to the Schrödinger equation,
%
\begin{align}
    \odv[]{}{t} \ket{\Em(t)} = \Ell[a^\dagger, a] \ket{\Em(t)},
\end{align}
%
which has the formal solution
%
\begin{align}
    \ket{\Em(t)}
    = 
    e^{\Ell[a^\dagger, a](t-t_0)}
    \ket{\Em(t_0)}.
\end{align}
%


In addition to the \emph{ket} vectors, $\ket{\cdot}$, we introduce the corresponding \emph{dual vectors}, or \emph{bra}'s, denoted $\bra{\cdot}$.
Since $\ket{N} = z^N$, we can consider $\ket{\Em(t)} = \sum_N P(N, t)\ket{N}$ as an element of the vector space of analytic functions, $V$, with $P(N, t)$ as the components.
\note{I guess the vector space is actually $\ell^1$, since $\sum |P(N)| = 1$? So a different space than Fokk space, which is $\ell^2$.}
When we have such a vector space, \emph{Riesz representation theorem} says that the space of all linear operators from $V$ to real numbers, $V^*$, is also a vector space, with a basis of elements $\bra{M} \in V^*$ such that
%
\begin{align}
    \braket{M|N} = \delta_{M,N}.
\end{align}
%
This is the dual space, and $\bra{M}$ is the basis for dual vectors.
The inner product is defined as
%
\begin{align}
    \braket{\cdot| N} &= \int \dd z \, \cdot z^N, \\
    \braket{M| \cdot} & = \int \dd z \, \frac{ (-1)^M }{ M! } \delta^{(M)}(z) \cdot.
\end{align}
%
Here, $\delta^{(M)}(z)$ is the M'th derivative of the Dirac delta, defined by partial integration,
%
\begin{align}
    \int \dd z \, \delta^{(N)} f(z)
    = 
    (-1)^N f^{(N)}(0)
    \implies 
    \braket{M | \Em{t}} = P(N, t).
\end{align}
%

The action of the operators on the dual vector can be deduced as follows:
%
\begin{align}
    \bra{M} \left(a \ket{N}\right)
    &= N \braket{M|N-1} = N \delta_{M, N-1}
    = (M - 1) \braket{M+1 | N}\\
    \implies 
    \bra{M}a & = (M + 1)\bra{M + 1}.
\end{align}
%
and
\begin{align}
    \bra{M} \left(a^\dagger \ket{N}\right)
    &= \braket{M|N+1} = \delta_{M, N-1}
    = \braket{M-1 | N}\\
    \implies 
    \bra{M}a^\dagger & = \bra{M - 1}.
\end{align}
% 
From this, we get
%
\begin{align}
    \bra{M} &= \bra{0} \frac{ a^\dagger }{ M! }, &
    \braket{M|\cdot} &= \bra{0} \frac{ a^\dagger }{ M! }\ket{\cdot}, &
    \braket{0|\cdot} = \int \dd z \, \delta(z)\cdot.
\end{align}
%
We may write moments as
%
\begin{align}
    \E{N^k(t)} 
    =
    \sum_N \left(z \odv{  }{ z }\right)^k z^N \big|_{z = 1} P(N, t)
    =
    \sum_N \left(z \odv{  }{ z }\right)^k\Em(z, t)\big|_{z = 1}
    =
    \int \dd z \, \delta(z - 1)
    \sum_N \left(z \odv{  }{ z }\right)^k\Em(z, t).
\end{align}
%
We may Taylor-expand this around $z = 0$, so
%
\begin{align}
    \E{N^k(t)} 
    =
    \sum_m
    \int \dd z \, \frac{ \delta(z) }{ m! }
    \odv[m]{  }{ z }
    \sum_N \left(z \odv{  }{ z }\right)^k\Em(z, t)
    =
    \bra{0}e^a (a^\dagger a)^k \ket{\Em(t)}.
\end{align}
%
We call
%
\begin{align}
    \bra{0}e^a
    \equiv
    \bra{\star}
\end{align}
%
the \emph{coherent state}, or \emph{abyss}.

\emph{
    Maybe a bit on the differences from QM, this is not quite clear to me.
    The operators are not unitary, right?
    Is the dagger actually hermitian conjugate?
    etc...
